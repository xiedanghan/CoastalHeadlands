*Coastal Circulation Cells Around Headland* is a numerical modelling study investigating the impacts of a coastal headland on nearshore hydrodynamics. Here, a basic set-up of this modelling research is introduced. More detailed results regarding this research can be freely accssed through the link: https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL105323.

## Highlights
###### 1. The Formation of Circulation Cells and Wave Energy Convergence Around Headlands During Storms Reduce Bottom Shear Stress at the Beach

###### 2. Sea-Level Rise Increases Wave Heights, Currents, and Bed Shear Stress in the Nearshore Because of Landward Shifting of the Circulation Cells

###### 3. Higher Storm Waves Expand the Surf Zone, Shift Circulation Cells Seaward

###### 5. Increase in Velocity or Bed Shear Stress due to SLR is Balanced By Increasing Wave Height, leading to minimal changes in these two variables under certain combinations. Hence, the Combinations of SLR and Wave Height are of Critical Importance in Determining Hydrodynamic Changes Along the Beach in the Future
