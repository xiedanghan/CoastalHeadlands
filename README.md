*Coastal Circulation Cells Around Headland* is a numerical modelling study investigating the impacts of a coastal headland on nearshore hydrodynamics. Here, a basic set-up of this modelling research is introduced. More detailed results regarding this research can be freely accssed through the link: https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL105323.
